# Game-of-Life
## John Conway's Game of Life
Game of Life was the brain child of the one of the greatest mathematician John Horton Conway. Game of life is Turing compelete, i.e., one can simluate the Game of Life on Game of Life. Game of Life is udecidable that is we can't tell if a pattern will continue forever, or reach a steady state, or fade away. In this repo I have provided python code for simulating game of life using different patterns. Detailed discussion has been provided in the code.
